What does it do?
================

The **ZHdK MAdeK Player** is a typo3 plugin which connects to a media server named MAdeK. The media saved as a set in the MAdeK server, is used by the player to create a simple and clear slideshow.
The plugin will only play images, because the current public MAdeK API doens't support other media. 

The format can be set up just as one like it.
