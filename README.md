About ZHdK MAdeK Player
=======================

Introduction
------------

The ZHdK MAdeK Player is a Typo3 extension which enables Typo3 users to display
a gallery with images from a user-defined MAdeK server. This plugin is designed
to be a simple client to a MAdeK server and doesn't let the user overrule any
data from MAdeK (e.g. you can't overwrite metadata or define an order).

Use
---
**Different MAdeK server**  
If you want to use a different MAdeK server than
[medienarchiv.zhdk.ch](http://medienarchiv.zhdk.ch/) you must define it in the extension configuration.

**Show a gallery**  
Insert the "ZHdK MAdeK Player" as a plugin on a normal page and select a
MAdeK set with the "MAdeK Set Picker". Done.

About MAdeK
===========

MAdeK is short for 'Medienarchiv der Künste', a project at the Zürich University
of the Arts.

The goal is to release a media archival, management and sharing system that can
archive video, audio and image files along with their metadata. The system
crowdsources the chore of retrieving and assigning metadata to the users
themselves instead of putting all the burden on the archival expert.

MAdeK is also on [Github](https://github.com/zhdk/madek)
