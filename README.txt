= About ZHdK Madek Player =
== Introduction ==
The ZHdK Madek Player is a Typo3 extension which enables Typo3 users to display a gallery with images from a user-defined Madek server. This plugin is designed to be a simple client to a Madek server and doesn't let the user overrule any data from Madek (e.g. you can't overwrite metadata or define an order).

== Use ==
=== Different Madek server ===
If you want to use a different Madek server than http://medienarchiv.zhdk.ch/ you must define it in the extension configuration.

=== Show a gallery ===
Insert the "ZHdK Madek Player" as a plugin on a normal page and select a Madek set with the "Madek Set Picker". Done.

== Contribute ==
The "ZHdK Madek Player" code is managed on https://github.com/beatrohrer/zhdk_madekplayer

== About Madek ==
MAdeK is short for 'Medienarchiv der Künste', a project at the Zürich University of the Arts.

The goal is to release a media archival, management and sharing system that can archive
video, audio and image files along with their metadata. The system crowdsources the chore of
retrieving and assigning metadata to the users themselves instead of putting all the burden
on the archival expert.

Madek is also on Github: https://github.com/zhdk/madek
